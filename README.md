# VBA_Challenge
 
## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Here we are set to the task of refactoring VBA code to collect stock data in the years 2017 and 2018. Once the data is run through our code the user will be able to swiftly see which stocks are worth their investment. Our goal was to refactor the original code to make the process run quicker.

### Our Dataset

From the 12 data sets we were presented with (ticker value, stock issue date, opening, closing and adjusted closing price, highest and lowest price, volume of stock) the goal was to analyse the ticker, total daily volume, and the returm on each individual stock.
